# PrayerLabyrinth2

add more cool things to look at: buildings, Vatican

test prayerlabyrinth in VR - not sure if I should do gaming laptop or gaming PC desktop

add UI to select "on rails" or "you move"; choice between rosary and stations of the cross; find big book of Don Monette recordings

add posts with pix of public domain stations of cross

at center should have signposts to indicate where people should go

Put some sort of conclusion sign / artwork : "You have now completed the labyrinth.  Please click __ to return to the Main Menu."
Put introductory sign near entrance to Labyrinth: "Please stay on path" etc.
Fix houses in ground, etc.
Test again with new locations of triggers

Later
Add choice to do rosary instead.

At the center, should have signposts to indicate where people should go.  
Maybe trigger, at end of closing prayer, a menu/sign coming up that indicates they are done and they can either walk around or click 'q' to end and go back to main menu.
Get deal with praystation portable guys for content?
Fix both houses in center section.

This is the correct position for the FPS controller:
position: x = 19, y = 52, Z = 206
Rotation: x = 0; y = 179; z=0
Scale = (1,1,1)

add music?
